**xregister** is a set of XML tools that automates _Configuration Register Module_ design and verification in SoC design. RTL, REF, RAL (_Register Abstract Level_), Doc, C Header, etc are generated to synchronize SW/HW co-design.

**xregister** is currently finished and used in real project, just [checkout](http://code.google.com/p/xregister/source/checkout) and use it at your convenience.
